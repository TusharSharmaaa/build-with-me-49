## Play Store Preparation

### Step 1: Wrap PWA with Capacitor for Android

#### Install Capacitor Dependencies
```bash
npm install @capacitor/core @capacitor/cli @capacitor/android
```

#### Initialize Capacitor
```bash
npx cap init
```

**Configuration values:**
- **App ID:** `com.aitoolslist.app`
- **App Name:** `AI Tools List`

#### Create `capacitor.config.ts`
```typescript
import { CapacitorConfig } from '@capacitor/core';

const config: CapacitorConfig = {
  appId: 'com.aitoolslist.app',
  appName: 'AI Tools List',
  webDir: 'dist',
  server: {
    androidScheme: 'https',
    cleartext: true,
    // For development with hot reload:
    // url: 'https://6d6ef95b-7943-4044-814c-e44ec5423c6d.lovableproject.com?forceHideBadge=true'
  },
  plugins: {
    SplashScreen: {
      launchShowDuration: 2000,
      backgroundColor: "#2563EB",
      showSpinner: false
    }
  }
};

export default config;
```

#### Build and Add Android Platform
```bash
npm run build
npx cap add android
```

#### Sync Web Assets to Android
```bash
npx cap sync android
```

---

### Step 2: Add AdMob App ID to AndroidManifest.xml

Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add:

```xml
<manifest>
  <application>
    <!-- Add this inside <application> tag -->
    <meta-data
      android:name="com.google.android.gms.ads.APPLICATION_ID"
      android:value="ca-app-pub-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX~YYYYYYYYYY"/>
  </application>
</manifest>
```

**Note:** Replace `ca-app-pub-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX~YYYYYYYYYY` with your actual AdMob App ID from:
https://apps.admob.google.com/

---

### Step 3: Generate Signed AAB (Android App Bundle)

#### Create a Keystore (First Time Only)
```bash
cd android
keytool -genkeypair -v -keystore ai-tools-release.keystore \
  -alias ai-tools-key -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
```

Save the keystore password and key alias safely!

#### Configure Signing in `android/app/build.gradle`
Add this inside `android {}` block:

```gradle
android {
  ...
  
  signingConfigs {
    release {
      storeFile file('../ai-tools-release.keystore')
      storePassword 'YOUR_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD'
      keyAlias 'ai-tools-key'
      keyPassword 'YOUR_KEY_PASSWORD'
    }
  }
  
  buildTypes {
    release {
      signingConfig signingConfigs.release
      minifyEnabled true
      proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android-optimize.txt'), 'proguard-rules.pro'
    }
  }
}
```

#### Build the AAB
```bash
cd android
./gradlew bundleRelease
```

**Output:** `android/app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab`
