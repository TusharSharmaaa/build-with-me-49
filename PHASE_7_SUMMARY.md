# Phase 7 Complete - Growth & Content Expansion ✅

## What Was Implemented

### 1. ✅ Admin Role System & Dashboard
**Security-First Implementation:**
- Created `user_roles` table with enum type (`admin`, `moderator`, `user`)
- Implemented security definer function `has_role()` to prevent RLS recursion
- Added RLS policies for role-based access control
- Created admin-only hook `useAdminRole()` for client-side checks

**Admin Dashboard (`/admin`):**
- **Submissions Management Tab:**
  - View all tool submissions with status badges (pending, approved, rejected)
  - Approve or reject submissions with one click
  - Automatically updates submission status in database
  - Only visible to users with admin role

- **Notifications Tab:**
  - Send push notifications to all users
  - Custom title, message, and URL
  - Integrates with existing push notification edge function
  - Input validation and character limits

**Access Control:**

---

### 2. ✅ Tool Submission Approval Workflow
**Enhanced Submission Process:**

   - Copy your user email

2. **Run SQL in Supabase:**
   - Open Lovable backend database
   - Run this query (replace with your user ID):
   ```sql
   -- First, get your user ID
   SELECT id FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';
   
   -- Then insert admin role
   INSERT INTO user_roles (user_id, role)
   VALUES ('your-user-id-here', 'admin');
   ```

3. **Refresh the app:**
   - Log out and log back in
   - You should now see "Admin Dashboard" in Profile

### Sending Weekly Notifications
**Manual Method (Current):**

CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_cron;

-- Schedule weekly notification
SELECT cron.schedule(
  'weekly-new-tools-notification',
  '0 9 * * 1', -- Every Monday at 9 AM
  $$
  SELECT net.http_post(
    url := 'https://your-project.supabase.co/functions/v1/send-push-notification',
    headers := '{"Content-Type": "application/json", "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_ANON_KEY"}'::jsonb,
    body := '{"title": "New AI Tools This Week!", "body": "Check out the latest AI tools added to the directory.", "url": "/"}'::jsonb
  );
  $$
);
```

SET featured = true, featured_order = 1 
WHERE name = 'ChatGPT';

UPDATE ai_tools 
SET featured = false 
WHERE name = 'ChatGPT';
