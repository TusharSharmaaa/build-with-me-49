# AdMob Setup Guide

This guide will help you integrate your real AdMob account with the AI Tools List app.

## Prerequisites

âœ… You mentioned you already have an AdMob account set up
âœ… Ads are currently configured but using **test IDs** (placeholders)
âœ… Duplicates removed from database

## ðŸŽ¯ What's Already Done

The app is pre-configured with:
- âœ… Banner ads (shown on tool listings and search results)
- âœ… Interstitial ads (shown after viewing 2 tool details)
- âœ… Rewarded video ads (shown after 10 searches to unlock bonus tools)
- âœ… Ad frequency caps to prevent ad fatigue
- âœ… Analytics tracking for ad impressions

## ðŸ“‹ Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Get Your AdMob Ad Unit IDs

1. Go to [AdMob Console](https://apps.admob.com)
2. Select your app (or create one if you haven't)
3. Create ad units for each type:

#### Create Banner Ad Unit
- Click **"Ad units"** â†’ **"Add ad unit"**
- Select **"Banner"**
- Name it: `AI Tools List - Banner`
- Copy the **Ad unit ID** (format: `ca-app-pub-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/YYYYYYYYYY`)

#### Create Interstitial Ad Unit
- Click **"Add ad unit"** again
- Select **"Interstitial"**
- Name it: `AI Tools List - Interstitial`
- Copy the **Ad unit ID**

#### Create Rewarded Video Ad Unit
- Click **"Add ad unit"** again
- Select **"Rewarded"**
- Name it: `AI Tools List - Rewarded Video`
- Copy the **Ad unit ID**

#### Get Your App ID
- In AdMob, go to **"App settings"**
- Copy your **AdMob App ID** (format: `ca-app-pub-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX~ZZZZZZZZZZ`)

### 2. Configure Your Ad IDs in Lovable

The secrets you just set up need to be filled with your real AdMob IDs:

<lov-actions>
  <lov-open-backend>Open Backend to Configure Secrets</lov-open-backend>
</lov-actions>

Navigate to **Edge Functions > Secrets** and update these values:

| Secret Name | Your Value | Example |
|-------------|------------|---------|
| `ADMOB_APP_ID` | Your App ID | `ca-app-pub-1234567890123456~1234567890` |
| `ADMOB_BANNER_ID` | Your Banner Ad Unit ID | `ca-app-pub-1234567890123456/1234567890` |
| `ADMOB_INTERSTITIAL_ID` | Your Interstitial Ad Unit ID | `ca-app-pub-1234567890123456/0987654321` |
| `ADMOB_REWARDED_ID` | Your Rewarded Video Ad Unit ID | `ca-app-pub-1234567890123456/1122334455` |

### 3. Test Your Ads

**Important:** During development, ads will show as placeholders in the web preview. Real ads only work in the native Android app built with Capacitor.

To build the Android app:
1. Follow the deployment guide in `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`
2. Build APK/AAB with Capacitor
3. Install on a real device (not emulator)
4. Test each ad type:
   - Banner: Opens any category page
   - Interstitial: View 2 different tool details
   - Rewarded: Search 10 times

### 4. Ad Placement Summary

| Ad Type | Location | Trigger |
|---------|----------|---------|
| **Banner** | Bottom of Tool Listings & Search | Always visible |
| **Interstitial** | After Tool Detail Views | Every 2nd tool view (minimum 2 min gap) |
| **Rewarded Video** | Premium Tools Page | After 10 searches (minimum 5 min gap) |

### 5. Ad Revenue Optimization Tips

ðŸ“Š **Best Practices:**
- Keep interstitial frequency at 2-3 views (set in `src/lib/ads.ts`)
- Don't show interstitials on first visit (wait for user engagement)
- Use rewarded ads for premium features to increase completion rate
- Monitor eCPM in AdMob dashboard
- Test different ad frequencies based on user feedback

ðŸŽ¯ **Current Settings** (in `src/lib/ads.ts`):
```typescript
interstitialEveryNDetails: 2,  // Show after every 2 tool details
interstitialMinSeconds: 120,   // Minimum 2 minutes between interstitials
rewardedEveryNSearches: 10,    // Offer rewarded video after 10 searches
rewardedMinSeconds: 300,       // Minimum 5 minutes between rewarded ads
```

### 6. Monitor Performance

Once live, track your ad performance:
- **AdMob Dashboard**: Revenue, eCPM, fill rate, impressions
- **App Analytics**: User sessions, ad click-through rate
- **User Feedback**: Watch for complaints about ad frequency

## ðŸš¨ Common Issues

### Issue: Ads not showing in web preview
**Solution:** This is normal. Real ads only work in the native Android app. Web preview shows placeholders.

### Issue: "Ad failed to load" error
**Solution:** 
1. Verify your Ad Unit IDs are correct in secrets
2. Ensure your AdMob account is approved (can take 1-2 days)
3. Check that you have a payment method set up in AdMob

### Issue: Low ad fill rate
**Solution:**
1. Enable mediation in AdMob for better fill
2. Add more ad networks (Facebook Audience Network, Unity Ads)
3. Target specific countries with higher fill rates

## ðŸ“± Native App Integration

For the ads to work in production, you need to:

1. **Build Android App** using Capacitor (see `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`)
2. **Install AdMob Plugin**:
   ```bash
   npm install @capacitor-community/admob
   npx cap sync
   ```
3. **Update `capacitor.config.ts`** with your App ID
4. **Build & Deploy** to Google Play

## âœ… Next Steps

1. âœ… Set your real AdMob IDs in the secrets (button above)
2. âœ… Test ad frequency by browsing the app
3. âœ… Build Android app with Capacitor
4. âœ… Submit to Google Play
5. âœ… Monitor AdMob dashboard for revenue
